    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, we will look at another matrix factorization technique called Alternating Least Squares (ALS). This method can prove to be much more effective and robust than SVD we saw earlier. ALS allows you to set regularization measures and minimize a loss function while optimizing the model parameter `k`.  We will briefly look at the maths behind this approach in this lesson, before putting it into practice next. \n",

    "- Introduce a learning function for optimal matrix decomposition\n",

An interesting results of the SVD decomposition is that we get the complete nested set of low-rank approximations. So if you'd like a rank 5 approximation and a rank 10 approximation, you can just compute the full SVD, grab the top 5 components from that decomposition to form the rank 5 approximation with the lowest MSE and grab the top 10 components for the rank 10 approximation with the lowest MSE. Meanwhile, ALS only gives you a __single rank approximation__. So if you wanted a rank 5 and rank 10 decomposition, you would need to run the ALS algorithm twice.\n",

It factors the user to item matrix A into the user-to-feature matrix U and the item-to-feature matrix M. It runs the ALS algorithm in a parallel fashion.  The ALS algorithm helps uncover the latent factors for big data in a distributed computation setup. It explain the observed user to item ratings and tries to find optimal factor weights to minimize the least squares between predicted and actual ratings while the data is split in a cluster of computers.\n",
